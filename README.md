# BlackJack

Hello!

This is my attempt at a game of black jack. 

My goal is to have:

css styling that looks professional
follow wireframe: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94718740/156015111-661ead63-0658-4953-ab99-80d7cbf68717.png)
functional functions that allow for playing of black jack
button and selecter on amount to gamble
hit and stay buttons
modal success messaage and incrasing the state that they havae thier money in. 
modal faluire message stating how much they lost - whata they wagered.
home landing page to host all my games on then blackjack as one of those games
I will have the ui attached numbers to imaages and each image has a value that needs to 

i will use a library for my styling in mataerial ui or try this for the first time.
